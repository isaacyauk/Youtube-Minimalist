# Youtube-Minimalist
Thanks for checking out the YouTube Minimalist extension. I'm so glad that you're here! I have always found myself to be easily distracted by YouTube on my PC and I imagine other users have similar feelings. It seems like from the moment I open the website, whether it's something flashy from my recommendations, or some small thumbnail in the corner while I am trying to watch something, my attention is almost immediately stolen away from what I was doing. (Kinda like what happens when I walk into a room and forget why I was in the room to begin with!) 

As a result, I have written this simple extension: YouTube Minimalist helps users maintain focus and productivity by creating a cleaner, more intentional browsing experience. This extension addresses YouTube's attention-grabbing issues in it's interface by simplifying the layout and removing distracting elements.

# Key Features
  • Redirects to your Subscriptions page, ensuring you see content only from creators you've chosen to follow
  • Hide algorithmic recommendations, Shorts, and "Watch Next" suggestions to discourage infinite scrolling
  • Hides comment sections and tertiary navigation elements
  • Disables infinite scroll via a page refresh and an excessive use alert
  • Applies clean, minimalist styling across site to encourage productivity and focus

# Installiation: 
If you're running this locally, the steps to get this running are quite simple:
  • Clone this project to your device
  • Navigate to your chrome://extensions/
  • Turn on the "Developer Mode" switch if you haven't already
  • Click on the "Load Unpacked" button in the top left of your screen
  • Navigate to wherever you cloned project and select it
  • You're done! Now it will behave like any other extension you have.

# Notes
I know you might be wondering: why does this exist? Aren't there better tools already made out there? 

Well, sure. Probably. But not all of them are consistent or reliable, like I belive I can make this one to be. As an added bonus, it's not hard to tell that this isn't spyware and that I'm not a Russian or Chinese bot, like so much of the existing content on the Chrome Extension Store is...

If you have any questions, concerns, or if something breaks, open up an issue or shoot me an email/message where you find me on my socials. I'll be using this tool daily and will not only know when something breaks and where to fix it, but I'll also be invested in any issues you might open up!

Happy browsing!
